# Polyscope

Polyscope is a mutation of Microscope from  is a simple social news app that lets you share links, comment, and vote on them.

Microscope was built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) as a companion app to [The Meteor Book](http://themeteorbook.com), and is the "little brother" of [Telescope](http://telesc.pe), the (much more complex) open-source social news app that was the inspiration for the book.

Polyscope & Microsocope are free and open-source, and are an excellent example of common Meteor & Polymer app patterns such as:

- Routing
- User Accounts
- Notifications
- Errors
- Publications/Subscriptions
- Permissions
- Polymer core-elements
- Polymer paper-elements
- Polymer custom-elements (in my example I use some components from differential [Blogpost](http://differential.com/blog/meteor-polymer)
- Material design inspirations
