Polyscope is a [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) / [Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) mutation of Microscope from [The Meteor Book](http://themeteorbook.com) which is a simple social news app that lets you share links, comment, and vote on them.

Microscope was built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) as a companion app to [The Meteor Book](http://themeteorbook.com), and is the "little brother" of [Telescope](http://telesc.pe), the (much more complex) open-source social news app that was the inspiration for the book.

Here is a [live Demo](http://polyscope.meteor.com)!

Polyscope & Microsocope are free and open-source, and are an excellent example of common Meteor & Polymer app patterns such as:

- Routing
- User Accounts
- Notifications
- Errors
- Publications/Subscriptions
- Permissions
- Polymer core-elements
- Polymer paper-elements
- Polymer custom-elements (in my example I use some components from differential) [Blogpost](http://differential.com/blog/meteor-polymer)
- Material design inspirations

Hope this will be useful for one or the other and feel free to submit issues and pull requests.
